It was all much more tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the strength to resist, and hurried off to school."

But now it was all so still!  I had counted on the commotion to get to my desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M.Hamel walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody. You can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was. But nothing happened. M.Hamel saw me and said very kindly, \u201cGo to your place quickly, little Franz. We were beginning without you.\u201d I jumped over the bench and sat down at my desk. Not till then, when I had got a little over my fright, did I see that our teacher had on his beautiful green coat, his frilled shirt, and the little black silk cap, all embroidered, that he never wore except on inspection and prize days. Besides, the whole school seemed so strange and solemn. But the thing that surprised me most was to see, on the back benches that were always empty, the village people sitting quietly like ourselves; old Hauser, with his three-cornered hat, the former mayor, the former postmaster, and several others besides. Everybody looked sad; and Hauser had brought an old primer, thumbed at the edges, and he held it open on his knees with his great spectacles lying across the pages."

It was because they were sorry, too, that they had not gone to school more.

But I got mixed up on the first words and stood there, holding on to my desk, my heart beating, and not daring to look up. I heard M.Hamel say to me, \u201cI won\u2019t scold you, little Franz; you must feel bad enough. See how it is! Every day we have said to ourselves, \u2018Bah! I\u2019ve plenty of time. I\u2019ll learn it tomorrow.\u2019 And now you see where we\u2019ve come out. Ah, that\u2019s the great trouble with Alsace; she puts off learning till tomorrow. Now those fellows out there will have the right to say to you, \u2018How is it; you pretend to be Frenchmen, and yet you can neither speak nor write your own language?\u2019 But you are not the worst, poor little Franz. We\u2019ve all a great deal to reproach ourselves with.\u201d \u201cYour parents were not anxious enough to have you learn. They preferred to put you to work on a farm or at the mills, so as to have a little more money. And I? I\u2019ve been to blame also. Have I not often sent you to water my flowers instead of learning your lessons? And when I wanted to go fishing, did I not just give you a holiday?\u201d Then, from one thing to another, M.Hamel went on to talk of the French language, saying that it was the most beautiful language in the world \u2014 the clearest, the most logical; that we must guard it among us and never forget it, because when a people are enslaved, as long as they hold fast to their language it is as if they had the key to their prison. Then he opened a grammar and read us our lesson. I was amazed to see how well I understood it. All he said seemed so easy, so easy! I think, too, that I had never listened so carefully, and that he had never explained everything with so much patience. It seemed almost as if the poor man wanted to give us all he knew before going away, and to put it all into our heads at one stroke."

Fancy! For forty years he had been there in the same place, with his garden outside the window and his class in front of him, just like that. Only the desks and benches had been worn smooth; the walnut-trees in the garden were taller, and the hopvine that he had planted himself twined about the windows to the roof. How it must have broken his heart to leave it all, poor man; to hear his sister moving about in the room above, packing their trunks! For they must leave the country next day. But he had the courage to hear every lesson to the very last. After the writing, we had a lesson in history, and then the babies chanted their ba, be bi, bo, bu. Down there at the back of the room old Hauser had put on his spectacles and, holding his primer in both hands, spelled the letters with them."

At the same moment the trumpets of the Prussians, returning from drill, sounded under our windows. M.Hamel stood up, very pale, in his chair. I never saw him look so tall. 'My friends,' said he, 'I\u2014I\u2014' But something choked him. He could not go on. Then he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk, and, bearing on with all his might, he wrote as large as he could \u2014 'Vive La France!' Then he stopped and leaned his head against the wall, and, without a word, he made a gesture to us with his hand \u2014 'School is dismissed \u2014 you may go.'"
