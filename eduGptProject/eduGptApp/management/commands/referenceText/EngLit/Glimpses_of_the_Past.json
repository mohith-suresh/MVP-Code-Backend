    "Initial Song": "Oh my countrymen! Let your eyes fill with tears, as you recall the sacrifices of India’s martyrs.",

    "British Expansion and Initial Reactions (1757-1765)": "With its superior weapons, the British East India Company was extending its power in 18th century India. Indian princes were short-sighted. That upstart Rajah Bah! Call the English merchants. They will help me to defeat him. The people had no peace due to such constant fights. A far-seeing ruler like the brave Tipu of Mysore fought the British till he died fighting! The rivalries helped the East India Company and it could easily subdue Indian princes one by one. Thank God, there is peace in the country now! No more wars and no looting by thugs! It is God who sent the British! Our destiny is linked with them!",
    
    "The Company's Conquests and Policies (1765-1849)": "The white man has killed or dethroned our kings. Some kings were not good, but after all, they were of this land. Now we have become slaves of foreigners! Religious leaders preached ideas like untouchability and child marriage. The truth was that Indians had lost self-respect. The British scorned them. Being merchants, the British wanted quick profits, their heavy taxes forced farmers to abandon their fields. All the misery in the world is due to women. But your men are taking all my crop! You are still in arrears. If you don’t pay next week. I will send you to jail. The natives are unworthy of trust, incapable of honesty. True, your honour, but I am honest. Still, the British invented other methods which gave them more profits. Inevitably famines followed. Between 1822 and 1836 fifteen lakh Indians died of starvation. The British policies ruined the expert artisans and their business. A good idea! The goods manufactured in England should not have any import duty when brought into India. The East India Company’s laws began to cripple Indian industries.",
    
    "Social and Religious Impact (1765-1835)": "Religious leaders preached ideas like untouchability and child marriage. The truth was that Indians had lost self-respect. The British scorned them.

The East India Company’s laws began to cripple Indian industries.",
    
    "Ram Mohan Roy and Social Reform (1772-1833)": "Ram Mohan Roy, a learned man from Bengal, understood what was wrong with the country. Let us not despise ourselves, our ancient culture is great. And we are capable of greater achievements. We must first reform our society. Superstitions have been ruining us. He told his wife Uma– Cows are of different colours, but the colour of their milk is the same. Different teachers have different opinions but the essence of every religion is the same. He was attracted by science and modern knowledge. Knowledge should be practical and scientific. He crossed the seas and went to England to see what made the British powerful. There he told them– We accept you as rulers, and you must accept us as subjects. But you must remember the responsibility a ruler owes to his subjects. He started newspapers but the suspicious British stopped them in 1823.",
    
    "Continued Oppression and Economic Exploitation (1765-1836)": "But the British continued to oppress Indians. In 1818, they had passed Regulation III. Under it, an Indian could be jailed without trial in a court. All the time British officers in India drew big salaries and also made fortunes in private business. By 1829, Britain was exporting British goods worth seven crore rupees to India. The British prospered on the Company’s loot while Indian industries began to die. Governor-General Bentinck reported back home – The bones of cotton weavers are bleaching the plains of India.",
    
    "Growing Dissatisfaction and Intellectual Awakening (1835-1856)": "We should teach the natives through the English language. I agree. English education produced clerks to whom the British gave petty jobs under them. Incidentally, it also produced a new generation of intellectuals. We must educate our brothers. And try to improve their material conditions. For that we must convey our grievances to the British Parliament. By 1856, the British had conquered the whole of India. Our kings have become puppets, and we have lost our old jobs. They cared little about the needs of Indians. And lands. They are converting our brothers! You only talk! Do something to drive then out!",
    
    "Sparks of Rebellion (1855-1857)": "Taxes continued to ruin the peasants. In Bengal, the Santhals who had lost their lands under new land rules, became desperate. In 1855, they rose in rebellion and massacred Europeans and their supporters alike. Discontent was brewing in the East India Company’s army too. The white soldier gets huge pay, mansions to live in, servants. While we get a pittance and slow promotions! The Angrez asks us to cross the sea which is against our religion. Who is the topiwala to abolish our age-old customs? We must drive out the Angrez. Thousands of other sepoys revolted. They were stripped of their uniforms, humiliated and put in irons. Sepoy Mangal Pande attacked the adjutant of his regiment and was executed. Few Englishmen had cared. Oh, proud Brahmin soldiers, do you know that the grease on the bullet you have to bite is made from the fat of cows and pigs? to understand Indian customs or the people’s mind. The white man has deceived us too! Soon, chapaties were sent from village to village to tell the people that their emperor would want their services. Similarly lotus flowers circulated among Indian soldiers. Death to the foreigner! Yes, all my village men will be ready. The masses gave all help and shelter to the patriots.",
    
    "The Revolt of 1857": "Then there was a violent outbreak at Meerut. The sepoys marched to Delhi. Long live our Emperor Bahadur Shah! The rebellion spread wider. Many landlords had lost their lands because of the British policies, and they were sore. The white man’s rule must end! Yes, we will help you.",
    
    "The Fight for Freedom": "Many former rulers like Begum Hazrat Mahal of Lucknow were bitter. The white man has taken away my kingdom! Popular leaders like Maulvi Ahmedulla of Faizabad told the people – Rise, brothers, rise! The Angrez is ruining our land! They joined the upsurge against the foreigner. Azimulla Khan told Tatya Tope We should have Peshwa Nana Saheb as our leader in this war of independence. Eighty-year old Kunwar Singh of Bihar received a bullet in his wrist. Mother Ganga! This is my last offering to you! The patriots pounced upon the British and fought pitched battles all over North India. The people rose everywhere, in Bareilly, Kanpur and Allahabad."
